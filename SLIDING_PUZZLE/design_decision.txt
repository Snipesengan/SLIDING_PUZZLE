Overview
I have decided to create an interface to implement one of the state model in
"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" which includes the following 
attributes:
    - States: A state description
    - Initial State: The intial state of the problem
    - Actions: possible moves that can be mode
    - Transition Model: Given a state and action, generate the resulting state
    - Goal test: Check whether we have reached our goal
    - Path cost: Cost of going from one state to the other
